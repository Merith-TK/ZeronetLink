# ZeronetLink
Zeronet bridge-redirector that can be shared instead of regular ZN links in following way:

https://zeronet.link/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/

It detects if ZN is working on a computer and then redirects to Zeronet url or offers option to download Zeronet client. The idea is to help people which are unfamiliar with ZN and don't know what to do with regular ZN link and would have to google for it.
